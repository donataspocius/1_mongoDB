Three tier application architecture

1. Representational | Front-End (or other client)
2. Application | Back-End (express.js) - info apdirbimas
3. Database | DB (mongoDB) - info saugojimas

Example of data creation: Representational sends data to -> Application (does data validation or other business related logic) -> Database saves it
